# HTTP Service Delay Analyzer for DPMI

This is a tool for analyzing the service delay for HTTP requests and responses, with picosecond precision.

This program is designed to work with cap files from [DPMI](https://github.com/DPMI) and uses [libcap_utils](https://github.com/DPMI/libcap_utils) for reading the cap file.

## Prerequisites
The `libcap_utils` must be installed and executable, see https://libcap-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html.
